EW DELHI: Home-grown mobile phone maker Micromax Informatics plans to invest up to Rs 600 crore over the next three years to transform itself into a consumer electronics company.

The Gurgaon-based company expects consumer durables to make up about a fourth of its total revenue over this period, as it seeks to enter new categories like washing machines and introduces new models for the existing range of air conditioners and televisions. The mobile phone maker, which has dropped off the top five ranking charts over 2016, diversified into consumer durables in 2013.

It now plans to take a place among the leading air conditioner companies, even when the space is as competitive as smartphones, though offers far better margins.

"We will invest abut `200 crore every year to build the channel and service," he added.

The company has introduced the Micromax Home Assist application that will allow its AC and TV consumers get after sales service from over 400 centres.
