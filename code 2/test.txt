Not everything that has a beginning has an end. Not every Bollywood movie that has been started by a director hits the theatre. There are movies that haven’t been completed despite the Khans and Dutts of Bollywood being a part of it.

And much to our surprise, one of those unreleased movies of Bollywood is a Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt starrer – DUS.

Back in 1997, Salman Khan, Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon were shooting a film named ‘Dus’ which unfortunately couldn’t be completed because of the sudden demise of its director, Mukul Anand.

‘Dus’ was Mukul Anand’s dream project and its story was based on terrorism. It is when they were shooting for this film in Utah, that he suffered a heart attack and the project got dismissed. The film was almost 40% complete and had even released one of its song that gained much popularity for its music. Being a patriotic song, it’s remembered even today for its brilliant music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy and unforgettable lyrics.

Had this film been released, it’d have marked the debut of the super talented music directors Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Have a look:

While Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt were to play army officers in the movie, Raveena Tandon was to be seen in a negative role. The story was about these two officers invading Pakistan in order to prevent fourth Indo-Pak war.

There was another song from the movie sung by Sukhwinder that was released back then.

If only the movie was released, we’re sure it’d have been a big hit at the box office, considering Salman was in his hay days back then. Anyway, maybe there’s someone who’d be willing to finish this one because if something doesn’t have an ending, it’s not really an end.
